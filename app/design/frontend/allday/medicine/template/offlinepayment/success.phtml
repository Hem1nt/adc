This depends on the agreement between you and your bank and is retained by your bank. This transaction fee varies from 0.5% to 3.0% of the value and thus you may see a small separate charge on this purchase.</p>

	<p class="message_content">Other major reason of the declined transaction may be due to the origination of the charge from a foreign country. Please inform your bank that you are expecting a charge in the name of Purelinestore.com from Latvia and that you have approved the same. Once you do this, please try again or you can easily complete the transaction over the phone.</p>
